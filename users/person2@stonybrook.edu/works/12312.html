<p><strong>Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he hadsacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and many were thenations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover he sufferedmuch by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home;but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through theirown sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the godprevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things,O daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.</strong></p><p><strong>So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home exceptUlysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his wife and country, wasdetained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into a large cave and wantedto marry him. But as years went by, there came a time when the gods settled thathe should go back to Ithaca; even then, however, when he was among his own people,his troubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pityhim except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not lethim get home.</strong></p><p><strong>Now Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world's end, and liein two halves, the one looking West and the other East. He had gone there toaccept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying himself at his festival;but the other gods met in the house of Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods andmen spoke first. At that moment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had beenkilled by Agamemnon's son Orestes; so he said to the other gods:</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing buttheir own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to Agamemnon'swife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew it would be thedeath of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do either of these things,inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his revenge when he grew up and wantedto return home. Mercury told him this in all good will but he would not listen,and now he has paid for everything in full.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>Then Minerva said, &quot;Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served Aegisthusright, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but Aegisthus is neitherhere nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart bleeds, when I think of hissufferings in that lonely sea-girt island, far away, poor man, from all hisfriends. It is an island covered with forest, in the very middle of the sea,and a goddess lives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after thebottom of the ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earthasunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses, andkeeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home,so that he is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may once moresee the smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of this, and yetwhen Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you with many a burntsacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so angry with him?&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>And Jove said, &quot;My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget Ulyssesthan whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more liberal in his offeringsto the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear in mind, however, that Neptuneis still furious with Ulysses for having blinded an eye of Polyphemus king ofthe Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter tothe sea-king Phorcys; therefore though he will not kill Ulysses outright, hetorments him by preventing him from getting home. Still, let us lay our headstogether and see how we can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified,for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>And Minerva said, &quot;Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, the godsnow mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send Mercury to theOgygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and that he isto return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca, to put heart into Ulysses'son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the Achaeans in assembly, andspeak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who persist in eating upany number of his sheep and oxen; I will also conduct him to Sparta and toPylos, to see if he can hear anything about the return of his dear father-for this will make people speak well of him.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>So saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable, with whichshe can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the redoubtablebronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith she quells the ranksof heroes who have displeased her, and down she darted from the topmost summitsof Olympus, whereon forthwith she was in Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses' house, disguised as a visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts infront of the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about to wait uponthem, some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning downthe tables with wet sponges and laying them out again, and some cutting upgreat quantities of meat.</strong></p><p><strong>Telemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily amongthe suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would send them flyingout of the house, if he were to come to his own again and be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them, he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took her right hand in his own, and bade her givehim her spear. &quot;Welcome,&quot; said he, &quot;to our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall tell us what you have come for.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>He led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were within hetook her spear and set it in the spear- stand against a strong bearing-postalong with the many other spears of his unhappy father, and he conducted herto a richly decorated seat under which he threw a cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet, and he set another seat near her for himself,away from the suitors, that she might not be annoyed while eating by theirnoise and insolence, and that he might ask her more freely about his father.</strong></p><p><strong>A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and pouredit into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the house, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them wine and poured it out for them.</strong></p><p><strong>Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats.Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids went round withthe bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water, andthey laid their hands upon the good things that were before them. As soonas they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted music and dancing,which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet, so a servant broughta lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled perforce to sing to them. As soonas he touched his lyre and began to sing Telemachus spoke low to Minerva,with his head close to hers that no man might hear.</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;I hope, sir,&quot; said he, &quot;that you will not be offended with what I am goingto say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, and all this isdone at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some wilderness or grinding topowder in the surf. If these men were to see my father come back to Ithaca theywould pray for longer legs rather than a longer purse, for money would not servethem; but he, alas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimessay that he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. Andnow, sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and where you come from. Tell meof your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how your crew brought you to Ithaca,and of what nation they declared themselves to be- for you cannot have come by land.Tell me also truly, for I want to know, are you a stranger to this house, or have youbeen here in my father's time? In the old days we had many visitors for my fatherwent about much himself.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>And Minerva answered, &quot;I will tell you truly and particularly all about it.I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I have come herewith my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue being bound forTemesa with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring back copper. As for my ship, itlies over yonder off the open country away from the town, in the harbour Rheithronunder the wooded mountain Neritum. Our fathers were friends before us, as oldLaertes will tell you, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that henever comes to town now,and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly, with an old woman to lookafter him and get his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from potteringabout his vineyard. They told me your father was at home again, and that waswhy I came, but it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for he is notdead yet not on the mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt islandin mid ocean, or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him against hiswill I am no prophet, and know verylittle about omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon me from heaven, andassure you that he will not be away much longer; for he is a man of suchresource that even though he were in chains of iron he would find somemeans of getting home again. But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses reallyhave such a fine looking fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like himabout the head and eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail for Troywhere the flower of all the Argives went also.Since that time we have never either of us seen the other.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;My mother,&quot; answered Telemachus, tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it is a wisechild that knows his own father. Would that I were son to one who had grown oldupon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is no more ill-starred manunder heaven than he who they tell me is my father.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>And Minerva said, &quot;There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while Penelope hassuch a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning ofall this feasting, and who are these people? What is it all about? Have you somebanquet, or is there a wedding in the family- for no one seems to be bringingany provisions of his own? And the guests- how atrociously they are behaving;what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectableperson who comes near them.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;Sir,&quot; said Telemachus, &quot;as regards your question, so long as my father was hereit was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their displeasure havewilled it otherwise, and have hidden him away more closely than mortal man wasever yet hidden. I could have borne it better even though he were dead, if he hadfallen with his men before Troy, or had died with friends around him when the daysof his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over hisashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the storm-winds havespirited him away we know not wither; he is gone without leaving so much as atrace behind him, and I inherit nothing but dismay. Nor does the matter end simplywith grief for the loss of my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet anotherkind; for the chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland islandof Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my houseunder the pretext of paying their court to my mother, who will neither point blank saythat she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end; so they are makinghavoc of my estate, and before long will do so also with myself.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;Is that so?&quot; exclaimed Minerva, &quot;then you do indeed want Ulysses home again.Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and if he is the man he waswhen I first knew him in our house, drinking and making merry, he would soonlay his hands about these rascally suitors, were he to stand once more uponhis own threshold. He was then coming from Ephyra, where he had been to begpoison for his arrows from Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-livinggods and would not give him any, but my father let him have some, for he wasvery fond of him. If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will have ashort shrift and a sorry wedding.</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return, and takehis revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you to set abouttrying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice, call the Achaeanheroes in assembly to-morrow -lay your case before them, and call heaven tobear you witness. Bid the suitors take themselves off, each to his own place,and if your mother's mind is set on marrying again, let her go back to herfather, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage giftsthat so dear a daughter may expect.As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take the best ship you can get,with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest of your father who has so long beenmissing. Some one may tell you something, or (and people often hear things inthis way) some heaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and askNestor; thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last ofall the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on his way home,you can put up with the waste thesesuitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand you hearof his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp,build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, havingdone all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or foul,you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead infancyany longer; have you not heard how people are singing Orestes' praises for havingkilled his father's murdererAegisthus? You are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, andmake yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must go back to my ship and tomy crew, who will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think the matterover for yourself, and remember what I have said to you.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;Sir,&quot; answered Telemachus, &quot;it has been very kind of you to talk to me inthis way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell me; Iknow you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little longertill you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will then give you apresent, and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I will give you one ofgreat beauty and value- a keepsake such as only dear friends give to oneanother.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>Minerva answered, &quot;Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at once.As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till I come again,and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very good one, and I willgive you one of no less value in return.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>With these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had givenTelemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about his father.He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the stranger had been a god,so he went straight to where the suitors were sitting.</strong></p><p><strong>Phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he told thesad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had laid upon the Achaeans.Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from her room upstairs, andcame down by the great staircase, not alone, but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;Phemius,&quot; she cried, &quot;you know many another feat of gods and heroes, such aspoets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I mourn ever without ceasing,and whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;Mother,&quot; answered Telemachus, &quot;let the bard sing what he has a mind to; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who makes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated return of the Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs most warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only man who never came back from Troy,but many another went down as well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom,your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for speech is man's matter,and mine above all others- for it is I who am master here.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying in her heart.Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes. But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters, and prayed each one that hemight be her bed fellow.</strong></p><p><strong>Then Telemachus spoke, &quot;Shameless,&quot; he cried, &quot;and insolent suitors, let us feastat our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it is a rare thing to heara man with such a divine voice as Phemius has; but in the morning meet me in fullassembly that I may give you formal notice to depart, and feast at one another'shouses, turn and turn about, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose topersist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with youin full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be no man to avenge you.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>The suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the boldness ofhis speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, &quot;The gods seem to have givenyou lessons in bluster and tall talking; may Jove never grant you to be chief inIthaca as your father was before you.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>Telemachus answered, &quot;Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing, I willbe chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of for me? It isno bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches and honour. Still, nowthat Ulysses is dead there are many great men in Ithaca both old and young,and some other may take the lead among them; nevertheless I will be chief inmy own house, and will rule those whom Ulysses has won for me.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, &quot;It rests with heaven to decide whoshall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your own house and overyour own possessions; no one while there is a man in Ithaca shall do youviolence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow, I want to know about thisstranger. What country does he come from? Of what family is he, and whereis his estate? Has he brought you news about the return of your father, orwas he on business of his own? He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurriedoff so suddenly that he was gone in a momentbefore we could get to know him.&quot;</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;My father is dead and gone,&quot; answered Telemachus, &quot;and even if some rumourreaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed sometimes sendfor a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophecyings no heed. As forthe stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus, chief of the Taphians, an oldfriend of my father's.&quot; But in his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.</strong></p><p><strong>The suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening; but whennight fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed each in his own abode.Telemachus's room was high up in a tower that looked on to the outer court;hither, then, he hied, brooding and full of thought. A good old woman,Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor, went before him with acouple of blazing torches. Laertes had bought her with his own money whenshe was quite young; he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewedas much respect to her in his household as he didto his own wedded wife, but he did not take her to his bed for he fearedhis wife's resentment. She it was who now lighted Telemachus to his room,and she loved him better than any of the other women in the house did, forshe had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened the door of his bed roomand sat down upon the bed; as he took off his shirt he gave it to the goodold woman, who folded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by hisbed side, after which she went out, pulled the doorto by a silver catch, and drew the bolt home by means of the strap. ButTelemachus as he lay covered with a woollen fleece kept thinking allnight through of his intended voyage of the counsel that Minerva had given him.</strong></p>
