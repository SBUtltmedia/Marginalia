<p>Abortion has been the topic of controversy for many decades. Many people believe that when a woman terminates a pregnancy, she is committing murder and others argue that a woman has the right to choose life or abortion. There are different procedures to choose when having an abortion, depending on the gestational age and the woman 's health a pill form abortion may be used up to 9 weeks gestation (mifepristone and misoprostol), but for women who are over 12-weeks gestation (late-term abortion), surgical abortion is used (Berer 25). In 1973, the supreme court ruled that abortion was to be legalized, Roe vs. Wade. Women were given the legal right to choose to terminate their pregnancies and make the correct arrangements for their decisions. Different states have different restrictions to accessing abortion procedures, making the woman 's choice to terminate pregnancy less accessible. Restricting a woman 's access to appropriate abortion clinics limits her right to choose. There are different forms of abortion and reasons why some women might make the choice to terminate their pregnancy, including but not limited too, medical issues, domestic violence, rape and having made irresponsible choices, but no matter the reason for the woman’s choice; it is her right to decide to have a child or to have an abortion.<br />The choice to terminate a pregnancy due to medical issues with the fetus and/or woman can be overwhelming and very emotional. During pregnancy, several tests are performed on women, and with today’s technology, birth defects, and abnormalities can be found early on for many cases, but not always. For some cases, abnormalities may be caught after a woman is<br />12- weeks gestation and then the abortion procedure changes.

No matter the reason a woman might choose abortion, she is the one that has to live with her decisions, nobody else but her. Whether illegal or legal if a woman feels that having a child is not the best option, she will find a way to terminate the pregnancy, potentially, causing a lot more problems in our communities. So why take the safest way possible to abort pregnancy away from women? When a woman decides to terminate the pregnancy, the decision does not affect the public nearly as much as it would if she kept the unwanted child. So why should the public or government determine the woman 's fate? The government should have the right to take the decision to terminate a pregnancy away from any woman just like no woman has the right to force any man to be a father.<br /></p>
