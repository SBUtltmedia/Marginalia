So before you begin, ask yourself about your own experience with the process of buying a product on eBay. How did the experience work out for you? How did it make you feel?  </p><p>A good listing on eBay should include a title that flows and a detailed description of the item that you are selling. In the description, first state the condition of the item. Next, include the brand name, model, color or any other information that describes the item. Be sure to also point out and describe any item defects as well.  </p><p>Also, within your product description, try not to focus exclusively on your product features such as the make and model of the item, but also on its benefits. And be sure to include all important standard details such as pricing and availability. </p><p>In aiming to display a professional listing appearance, try to minimize fluff words, such as ‘great’ or ‘wonderful’. Also, attempt to be precise by not displaying large volumes of text in your listing. Keep your item description to 200 words or less. And, use appropriate formatting that is also user friendly.</p><p>Since the default search setting on eBay is “Best Match” you will also want to include a thorough amount of relevant keywords, especially at the beginning of your listing. So, think about the terms you would use to search for the item that you’re going to market. </p><p>In addition to using the appropriate wording in your listing, be sure to post high quality pictures. All items being marketed on eBay must include at least one picture, and you can post up to twelve photos for free.

Be sure to post your positive customer feedback to increase your chances of selling future items on eBay!</p><p>Also, you’ll have one last chance before starting the auctioning process to preview your listing. So, make sure that your post is accurate and includes the right price with honest wording and details such as shipping information. </p><p>Finally, be sure to do a quick search of your own for the item you want to sell on eBay. This can help you to decide which keywords to use as a seller while also giving you a feel for your competition.</p>
