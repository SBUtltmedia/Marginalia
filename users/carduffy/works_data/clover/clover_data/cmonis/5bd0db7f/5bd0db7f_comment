{"isVisible":"true","userID":"cmonis","commentData":"<p>It&#39;s very interesting to see this comparative count of gruesome murders in the listed films. Given my perspective on films, these numbers of on-screen deaths seem relatively small. However, this piece (and accordingly all of the listed films) was produced five years before I was born. Since I&#39;m so accustomed to blood-soaked films and television, it stands to reason that slasher films have gotten more and more violent over time. Clover&#39;s observation ended up being more of a prediction.&nbsp;(Clayton Monis)<\/p>","type":"comment","startIndex":"544","endIndex":"718","timeStamp":"5bd0db7f","firstname":null,"lastname":null}
