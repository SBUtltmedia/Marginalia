I never noticed that about scary movied until reading this, but it is very true. Even as annoying as the girls scream might be when she encounters a killer, she is most likey able to get out of it. Interesting point of view that I never have thought about before.&nbsp;<\/p>","type":"comment","startIndex":"2066","endIndex":"2144","timeStamp":"5bcfb5b8","firstname":"McKenzie","lastname":"Bushee"}
