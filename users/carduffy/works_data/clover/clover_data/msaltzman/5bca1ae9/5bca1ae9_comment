{"isVisible":"true","userID":"msaltzman","commentData":"<p>Nudity and sexual demoralization in these slasher films is uncalled for, and is seeming to be more prevalent in more recent films. These scenes are exploitations, and are making the audience believe that women who uncover their bodies at all are asking for trouble and deserve the trouble that they are going to get. It makes the audience believe that any young girl who acts this way is a justifiable reason for her death, and this belief has almost become acceptable. It is very demeaning in society and is putting bad ideas into the minds of viewers, who might not even be aware of the seriousness of these meanings.
