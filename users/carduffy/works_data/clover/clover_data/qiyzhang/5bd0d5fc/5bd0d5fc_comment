But think about the movies I watched&nbsp;<em>Perfume: The Story of a Murderer<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>Port of Call<\/em>\uff0cand some other Hitchcock&#39;s movies, it does happened!! I&#39;m also wondering is that because of the female sexualization? Also the icon of&nbsp;violence on&nbsp;females was also broadly&nbsp;used in paintings, such as Picaso&#39;s&nbsp;<em>Guernica Icon of Peace<\/em>, Peter Paul Rubens&#39;s&nbsp;<em>The Rape of the Daughters of Leucippus<\/em>. Also in <em>Grimm&#39;s Fairy Tales&nbsp;<\/em>and some other literitual books, it&#39;s common to see detailed describtion of the violence on females. I&#39;m wondering is this phenomenon has a long cultural bias or other reasons?<\/p><p>(Erica Zhang)<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>","type":"analytical","startIndex":"3037","endIndex":"3154","timeStamp":"5bd0d5fc","firstname":null,"lastname":null}
