{"commentData":"<p>I think it&#39;s mostly fetishizing the female body, especially in slasher films where there is a lot of nudity. Exposing the body and using close shots may be a way to&nbsp;make&nbsp;the person seem more vulnerable on screen. And from a male cishet pov, since there werent many films from another pov during the time&nbsp;Clover wrote this, there is much less interest in other male bodies than there is in female bodies<\/p>","timeStamp":"5bd20df8","firstname":"Yvonne","lastname":"Chen","netid":"yvchen"}
