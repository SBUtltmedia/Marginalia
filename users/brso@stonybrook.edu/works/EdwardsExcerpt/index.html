<p>O sinner! Consider the fearful danger you are in: ‘tis a great furnace of wrath, a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of wrath, that you are held over in the hand of that God, whose wrath is provoked and incensed as much against you as against many of the damned in hell; you hang by a slender thread, with the flames of divine wrath flashing about it, and ready every moment to singe it, and burn it <strong>asunder<sup><a href="#footnote--1" id="footnote-ref--1">[1]</a></sup></strong>; and you have no interest in any Mediator, and nothing to lay hold of to save yourself, nothing to keep off the flames of wrath, nothing of your own, nothing that you ever have done, nothing that you can do, to <strong>induce<sup><a href="#footnote-0" id="footnote-ref-0">[2]</a></sup></strong> God to spare you one moment. </p><p>Your wickedness makes you as it were heavy as lead, and to tend downwards with great weight and pressure towards hell; and if God should let you go, you would immediately sink and swiftly descend and plunge into the bottomless gulf, and your healthy constitution, and your own care and prudence, and best contrivance, and all your righteousness, would have no more influence to uphold you and keep you out of hell, than a spider's web would have to stop a falling rock. Were it not that so is the sovereign pleasure of God, the earth would not bear you one moment; for you are a burden to it; the creation groans with you; the creature is made subject to the bondage of your corruption, not willingly; the sun don’t willingly shine upon you to give you light to serve sin and Satan; the earth don’t willingly yield her increase to satisfy your lusts; nor is it willingly a stage for your wickedness to be acted upon; the air don’t willingly serve you for breath to maintain the flame of life in your vitals, while you spend your life in the service of God's enemies. God's creatures are good, and were made for men to serve God with, and don’t willingly <strong>subserve<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[3]</a></sup></strong> to any other purpose, and groan when they are abused to purposes so directly contrary to their nature and end. And the world would spew you out, were it not for the sovereign hand of him who hath subjected it in hope. There are the black clouds of God's wrath now hanging directly over your heads, full of the dreadful storm, and big with thunder; and were it not for the restraining hand of God, it would immediately burst forth upon you. The <strong>sovereign<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[4]</a></sup></strong> pleasure of God for the present stays his rough wind; otherwise it would come with fury, and your destruction would come like a whirlwind, and you would be like the chaff of the summer threshing floor<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[5]</a></sup>.</p><p>The wrath of God is like great waters that are dammed for the present; they increase more and more, and rise higher and higher, till an outlet is given, and the longer the stream is stopped, the more rapid and mighty is its course, when once it is let loose. ‘Tis true, that judgment against your evil works has not been executed hitherto; the floods of God's vengeance<strong> </strong>have been withheld; but your guilt in the meantime is constantly increasing, and you are every day <strong>treasuring</strong> <strong>up<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[6]</a></sup></strong> more wrath; the waters are continually rising and waxing more and more mighty; and there is nothing but the mere pleasure of God that holds the waters back that are unwilling to be stopped, and press hard to go forward; if God should only withdraw his hand from the floodgate, it would immediately fly open, and the fiery floods of the fierceness and wrath of God would rush forth with inconceivable fury, and would come upon you with omnipotent power; and if your strength were ten thousand times greater than it is, yea, ten thousand times greater than the strength of the stoutest, sturdiest devil in hell, it would be nothing to withstand or endure it.</p><ol><li id="footnote--1"><p> <strong>asunder</strong> – into separate parts; in two, in pieces (OED) <a href="#footnote-ref--1">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-0"><p> <strong>induce</strong> – cause, prompt <a href="#footnote-ref-0">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-1"><p> <strong>subserve</strong> – to promote or assist; to act in a subordinate (inferior) position (OED) <a href="#footnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-2"><p> <strong>sovereign</strong> – reigning, all-powerful <a href="#footnote-ref-2">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-3"><p> Threshing is the process of separating a grain or seed from its husk <em>(See Footnote 8)</em> <a href="#footnote-ref-3">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-4"><p> <strong>treasuring up</strong> – hoarding, saving up <a href="#footnote-ref-4">↑</a></p></li></ol>
